# TempGBA4PSP-Single-game

Fork of TempGBA4PSP

## What is this?
This emulator is a modified a version of TempGBA4PSP that allows to launch roms straight from the PSP Menu! It works by having a multiple instances of this emulator, each one for each game.

## Usage
- Download this emulator from the [releases tab](https://github.com/GrabowskiDev/TempGBA4PSP-Single-game/releases)
- Put you GBA game in roms folder, and name it `game.gba` (It needs to be unzipped)
(Note: If you're importing save file or config, put them in respective folders and also name them `game`)
- Optional: Change the icon and background picture of the PBP to mach the game (I suggest using [PSP Brew](https://www.brewology.com/downloads/download.php?id=5487&mcid=1) but you may use any program for this)
- Drag your TempGBA folder onto your PSP memory card (into PSP/GAME folder)
- Enjoy your game!
