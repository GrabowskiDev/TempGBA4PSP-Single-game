GBA2PSP is a utility to automate the process to install GBA games and the
TempGBA-Single-Game emulator on a PSP.

It can automatically install ICON0/PIC0/PIC1 and SND0.AT3 either via the command
line or through links from the database gamedb.py.
Gamedb only contains links to assets for one game so far but
pull requests to add more links are welcome.

Usage:
======
usage: gba2psp.py [-h] [-v] [--psp-game-dir PSP_GAME_DIR] [--icon0 ICON0]
                  [--pic0 PIC0] [--pic1 PIC1] [--snd0 SND0]
                  game

positional arguments:
  game                  GBA image

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v                    Verbose
  --psp-game-dir PSP_GAME_DIR
                        Where to install the files (/PSP/GAME on your device)
  --icon0 ICON0         Image for ICON0
  --pic0 PIC0           Image for PIC0
  --pic1 PIC1           Image for PIC1
  --snd0 SND0           Image for SND0

ICON0/PIC0/PIC1 are either local files containing an image or a hyperlink.
In the latter case the content of the hyperlink will be downloaded and used as
the image. Images are scaled to the proper size, converted to PNG and injected
into PBOOT.PBP

SND0 is an audio file in any format or a http-link to a youtube video.
In the latter case the youtube video will be downloaded and used.
The audio will be converted to WAV format using FFMPEG and converted into
AT3 format using ATRACDENC.
The Audio will be clamped to a maximum of 60 seconds and 500kb.
The audio will be set to loop.

PSP-GAME-DIR should point to the PSP/GAME directory on the PSP/VITA.


Example 1: (using explicit files/links on the command line)
